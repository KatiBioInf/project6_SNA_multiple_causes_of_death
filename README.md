# project6_SNA_multiple_causes_of_death
Codes to perform social network analysis on historical multiple causes of death (centrality measures, network graphs and community detection)

The dataset is a random sample of death records of women aged 20 to 59 in Amsterdam between 1874 and 1881. Some death records contain multiple causes of deaths, hence, are eligible to be studied with social network analysis techniques. The original data are from the project titled: "Lifting the burden of disease. The modernisation of health in the Netherlands: Amsterdam 1854-1940" [link](https://www.ru.nl/en/research/research-projects/lifting-the-burden-of-disease-the-modernisation-of-health-in-the-netherlands-amsterdam-1854-1940).
